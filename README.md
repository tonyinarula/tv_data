# Super Bowl Viewership Trend Analysis

## Objective

Analyze historical Super Bowl viewership data to identify long-term trends and assess whether audience engagement has increased over time.

## Dataset

The dataset contains historical Super Bowl viewership figures by year. Each observation represents a single Super Bowl event, including the broadcast year and total number of viewers.

## Tools Used

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib
* **Techniques:** time-series trend analysis, exploratory data analysis, data visualization

## Key Questions

* How has Super Bowl viewership changed over time?
* Is there a clear long-term upward or downward trend in audience size?
* Are year-to-year fluctuations driven by noise or part of a broader pattern?

## Key Findings

* Super Bowl viewership shows a clear long-term upward trend
* Despite short-term fluctuations, average audience size has increased across decades
* The overall growth suggests sustained audience interest rather than one-off spikes

## Data Cleaning & Assumptions

* Data was assumed to be complete and correctly recorded for each year
* No inflation or population normalization was applied; analysis focuses on raw viewership counts
* Visual trend interpretation assumes consistent measurement methodology across years

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations

## Next Steps

* Normalize viewership by U.S. population to analyze per-capita engagement
* Segment analysis by broadcast network or game characteristics
* Apply statistical trend tests or regression modeling to quantify growth rates
